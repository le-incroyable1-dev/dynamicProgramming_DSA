/*
Code : Minimum Count
Send Feedback
Given an integer N, find and return the count of minimum numbers required to represent N as a sum of squares.
That is, if N is 4, then we can represent it as : {1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2} and {2^2}. 
The output will be 1, as 1 is the minimum count of numbers required to represent N as sum of squares.
